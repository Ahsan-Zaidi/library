## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I've created a Library app that utilizes a server-side API to gather information about your favorite books. The main purpose of this application is to function as a helpful tool for individuals seeking their next enjoyable read.
